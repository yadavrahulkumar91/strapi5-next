<h2>Capacitance and Capacitor</h2>



<h3>Capacitance</h3>
<img src="capacitor.png">

<p>Capacitance is a fundamental property of a capacitor that quantifies its ability to store electric charge and
    energy in an electric field. It is denoted by the symbol C and is measured in farads (F).</p>

<p>The capacitance of a capacitor is defined as the ratio of the magnitude of the electric charge (Q) stored on one
    of its plates to the potential difference (V) across the plates. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:</p>

<p align="center">
    $ C = \frac{{Q}}{{V}} $
</p>

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>C is the capacitance.</li>
    <li>Q is the magnitude of the charge.</li>
    <li>V is the potential difference.</li>
</ul>

<p>The capacitance depends on the physical characteristics of the capacitor, such as the geometry of the plates, the
    distance between them, and the dielectric material between the plates.</p>

<h3>Capacitor</h3>

<p>A capacitor is an electronic component designed to store and release electric charge and energy. It consists of
    two conductive plates separated by a dielectric material. The conductive plates are typically made of metal, while
    the dielectric material can be a non-conductive substance.</p>

<p>When a potential difference is applied across the plates of a capacitor, positive charges accumulate on one
    plate, and an equal amount of negative charges accumulate on the other plate. This separation of charges creates
    an electric field between the plates.</p>

<p>The ability of a capacitor to store charge and energy depends on its capacitance. A higher capacitance value
    indicates a larger charge storage capacity.</p>

<h3>Types of Capacitors</h3>

<p>There are various types of capacitors used in different applications, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Electrolytic capacitors: These capacitors have high capacitance values and are commonly used in power supply
        circuits.</li>
    <li>Ceramic capacitors: These capacitors have small physical sizes and are widely used in electronic devices.</li>
    <li>Film capacitors: These capacitors are made of a thin dielectric film and are used in various applications,
        including audio systems and power electronics.</li>
    <li>Tantalum capacitors: These capacitors have high capacitance and are commonly used in electronic circuits that
        require compact size.</li>
</ul>
